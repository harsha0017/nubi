## Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Standards

Nubi has a **zero-tolerance policy** toward Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). We strictly prohibit any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), grooming, solicitation, exploitation, or conduct that endangers minors.

We provide in-app reporting for users to flag inappropriate content or behavior. All reports are reviewed promptly, and confirmed CSAE violations are removed and reported to relevant law enforcement authorities as required by law.

We comply with applicable child safety laws and regulations and partner with global efforts to protect children from abuse and exploitation.
